# Metodi-LAB
first repository for the "Metodi e tecnologie per lo sviluppo software" course

# Tabs
- Code Tab: the CT contains all files included in the repository; those files might be about actual code, documentation or others.
- Issue Tab: issues are all things we want to do on our project, bug fixes included. Each issue can be assigned to a team member for its resolution.
- Pull Request Tab: pull requests are done when a developer wants to commit a change on one of the file's projects. They are organized in a way that makes it easier to review those changes.
- Projects Tab: this tab can be used to link projects between each others (not sure).
- Wiki Tab: it's an informational tab where everything can, more or less, be written.

# Basic Files
- README.md: it's the basic file that should be contained in every repository; it should contain basic informations about the project, such as it's goals, the team whom worked on the project, the sources, etc.
- Contributing.md: it's a file that contains information on how the work "should be done" when a new issue or a pull request is submitted.
