## How Issues Work
Even if the name says otherwise, an issue is not only a problem with the code. Issues can be opened to share ideas, code improvements, to report a bug or to indicate a task that must be done.

Also, the fact that issues can be linked between each other or with pull requests, and will be displayed in a single, ordered record, make their use a way better alternative to a constant mail exchange.
