# Markdown
Markdown is the basic syntax used by Github to format texts. Each text only file uses Markdown and is labeled with the .md extension.
## Headers
To create a header we need to type one (or more based on the importance) "#" symbol at the start of the line, followed by a space.
## Lists
Creating a list is simple: we just need one of those symbols, "*" or "-" followed by a space.
### Checklists
A particular kind of list is a checklist, for which we need a "-", a space and to open and close a square bracket "[ ]" with a space in between.
## Bold text
To make a text bolded we need to add a double asterisk on both side of that text.
## Cursive text
To type in cursive we need to add a single asterisk on both side of that text.
## Mentions
In the Issue Tab we can write comments for other developers; mentioning someone (with the at symbol "@" followed by the developer nickname) will send a notification to their account with the issue number and link.
## Cross linking
In the Pull Request Tab it's possible to link our (or a third party) pull request to an existing issue by using the "#" symbol followed by the issue's identification number.
